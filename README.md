## What is this?

This is a chat app. So far it has few features added, but there are a lot planned. To be exact:

1. User Interface (what you're looking at)
2. Authentication
3. Communication with a backend
4. E2E Encryption
5. The ability to find other users based on some sort of criterion
6. Create unit/e2e tests and storybook stories

## How do I run this?

Run `bun dev`. If you want to use another package manager, you will have to install the packages before doing so.

This is not currently hosted anywhere. When it gets to a good place, I will attempt to host the front and backends.

## Why

For the last year and a half, I have not been able to work on personal projects. And so when I looked back on my
portfolio, I saw a lot of projects that are old. They have good parts, and there are things that I like. But
things, especially the user interfaces, weren't good. They didn't make me happy to present as a representative
of me.

I always like taking on new challenges and working with technologies that I haven't used before, so I chose
Vue (okay, I used Vue 2, but I don't have anything with Nuxt or Vue 3), WebSockets and Elixir/Phoenix. Not
only did I use Vue 3, but I experimented with a bunch of CSS techniques that I didn't get to use at my job:
`color-mix`, `dialog::backdrop`, gradients of all styles, other package managers, etc.
And I'm incorporating some things I learned: Storybook and Playwright.
